<p><i>This was a group assignment and the report represents joint efforts of <br/><b>Keshav Srinivasan</b> (140260001) and <b>Kumar Ayush</b> (140260016)</i></p>
<p>This report describes the key features of our implementation of the descirbed features</p>
<h3>The textures</h3>
<p>We have used the code sent by the Course Instructor to load a texture in OpenGL and simply used TexCoord2d to specify texture co-ordinates before every point in our construction. There is a wooden texture for the floor, rough plaster for walls and roof, and an arbitrary color texture applied to the bicycle frame. The tires also have a texture. The only challenge here was figuring out the co-ordinates as we had not used glut functions to draw cylinders and torii but constructed them using triangle strips from scratch in the previous part</p>

<h3>The Lights</h3>
<p>There are <em>three</em> lights. LIGHT0 is just hovering midair in the room providing ambient lighting. LIGHT1 is lighting on the wall which can be turned on or off using <i>L</i>. The third light LIGHT2 is the cycle's headlight, which is off by default but can be toggled with <i>H</i></p>

<h3>The Cameras</h3>
<p>There is a casual side-view camera, which is set by default. There are three other cameras which can be toggled in and out. You have to come out of a camera mode before you enter another. '1' gives you the rider mode. We have made it such that it also rotates with the handle. '2' gives a Third Person view of the cycle which also moves with the cycle but does not rotate with the handle. '3' is just a camera on the wall, the creepy stalker watches everything from it.</p>

<h3>Making the spotlight come to life</h3>
<p>We made our walls out of 100x100 rectangles, 2x100x100 triangles per wall in total to render a good spotlight with Gourad shading. This took more time than expected as we were stupid at one point to assign 1/2 to a float variable instead of 1/2.0; :P </p>

<h3>Known Problem</h3>
<p>Whenever we change camera, the headlight vanishes until you press any key.</p>

<h3>Commands you should use while running the program</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Use <i>H</i> for Headlight Toggle</li>
    <li>Use <i>L</i> for Tubelight Toggle</li>
    <li>Use <i>left</i> and <i>right</i> for rotating the handle</li>
    <li>Use <i>up</i> and <i>down</i> arrow keys to move the cycle</li>
    <li>Use <i>1</i> for Rider Cam toggle</li>
    <li>Use <i>2</i> for Third Person toggle</li>
    <li>Use <i>3</i> for Wall Cam toggle</li>
</ul>
