<p>After I am able to imitate the smallpt output using ray integration, the only modification to produce a black hole is changing the integration equations. I start with the Schwarschild metric in isotropic co-ordinates and follow the methods described in <a target = "_blank" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03809">Interstellar paper</a>, to get the desired output. I sure had to tweak a bit with the scene to fit the black hole in the center of the room, as I had promised earlier. Follows an image of how a blackhole with Schwarschild radius of 5 units would look, before I explain a few assumptions that I made</p>

<p>As a bonus, here is an einstein ring with just the hole and a light source behind it</p>

<p>That's all folks! I'll probably do the explaining later</p>
